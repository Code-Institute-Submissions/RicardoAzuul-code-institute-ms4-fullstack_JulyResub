<!-- TODO: Add description of project: A book review and recommendation site, using MongoDB, Python, Flask, HTML, CSS and JavaScript. -->
Fit Family is a fitness subscription application.

The user's goal is to join a fitness community and purchase exercise plans and merchandise.

The site owner's goal is to build an active community around the product based on subscription and individual payments models, and to sell: exercise plans, nutrition plans, nutrition products and exercise products

Must haves for this project:
<!-- TODO: Must  haves -->
- Functionality that allows subscribers to update fellow members on their successes --> a forum?
- User proÔ¨Åles containing information that map to nutrition and/or exercise plans
- Product reviews
- A subscription-based payment model: on offer are 3 subscriptions, based on duration of subscription. Subscriptions get you access to workouts, nutrition plans, the community and a discount on the shop
- Individual item purchase capability
- Authentication and authorisation mechanism for subscribers and administrators

Nice to have:

## Deployment
<!-- TODO: Deployment -->
The project has been deployed to Heroku, with static files hosted on AWS S3. If  you want to do the same:
1. Fork the repository to your own GitHub: https://github.com/RicardoAzuul/code-institute-ms4-fullstack.
1. Log in to Heroku (www.heroku.com) - or register if you don't have an account yet.
1. In the Heroku dashboard, click the New button in the top right corner and create a new app.
1. Give your new app a name and choose a region. The name has to be unique within Heroku.
1. On the page for your new Heroku app, go to Deployment method and choose "Connect to GitHub". If you haven't connected your GitHub account to Heroku yet, you will be able to do so now.
1. Choose the forked repository of this project from your own GitHub account.
1. If you want, you can enable Automatic Deploys here: whenever you perform a push to your GitHub repository, the Heroku app can redeploy. Otherwise you can deploy manually. Heroku will use the PROCFILE and requirements.txt to install dependencies and build the app.
1. You will also have to set some Config Vars in the Settings section of your Heroku app. These are the Config Vars:
   1. AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: the id for your AWS S3 container
   1. AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: the secret key for your AWS S3 container
   1. DATABASE_URL: the url to the postgress database on Heroku
   1. EMAIL_HOST_PASS: the password or application key for the email account you use for emailing. This project uses Gmail
   1. EMAIL_HOST_USER: the emailadress
   1. SECRET_KEY: the Django secret key
   1. STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY: Your Stripe public key
   1. STRIPE_SECRET_KEY: Your stripe secret key
   1. STRIPE_WH_SECRET: Your Stripe webhook secret
   1. USE_AWS


### Run locally
<!-- TODO: Run locally -->
If you want to run the project locally:
1. First, fork the repository to your own GitHub: https://github.com/RicardoAzuul/code-institute-ms4-fullstack.
1. Clone the forked repository to your own machine.
1. Install Python 3.8.12, as this is what the project was built with: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3812/ (though if you're running Windows, install 3.8.10)
1. From the terminal, run the below to install required modules:
  ``` pip3 install -r requirements.txt ```
1. This also installs django-environ, which can be used to save environment variables.
1. https://alicecampkin.medium.com/how-to-set-up-environment-variables-in-django-f3c4db78c55f
3. You will need to create an .env file for running the app locally. Save it in the same directory as Django's settings.py. The content of this file:
```

```
1. To run the app:
   
   ``` python manage.py startserver ```

1. This will run the app locally, you can then browse to http://192.168.1.68:5000/ to interact with the app.
